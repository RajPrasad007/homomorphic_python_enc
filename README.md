A Python script to encrypt and decrypt data using Homomorphic Encryption Algorithm.

There are three inputs in the python file.

First one:- Give the data, it will encrypt and decrypt.

Second one:- Give the data and it will add to the encrypted data.(First one)


Third one:- Give the data and it will multiply the encrypted data.(First one)

There are three outputs:-

1-> Prints the encrypted data

2-> Prints the addtion and multiplication

3-> Prints the decrypted data


In this, I have used **phe** python module which helps in homomorphic cryptography. (A Python 3 library for Partially Homomorphic Encryption using the Paillier crypto system.)

**Install:**- pip install phe
